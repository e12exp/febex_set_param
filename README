Presets
=======

The presets/ folder contains some preset .db files, which are
auto-generated by make from the corresponding .par files.
A preset is a usual .db file which contains one module in some
useful pre-configured state.

To use a preset, all you need to do is to copy the module within
to your configuration file using the 'cp module' command of
setpar.

Example:
Assuming your settings file is febex.db and you want to use
the preset presets/pulser.db:

./setpar febex.db
> file open presets/pulser.db
> cp module 0 0 0 1 1
> save

See 'help file open' and 'help cp module' for more details on
opening files and copying modules between files.

To get a list of the available presets including their description
use the scripts/listpresets script.


The presets are stored in text form (.par) and compiled to
binary form during the build process. To create a new preset
file, prepare a .db settings file which only contains one module.
Configure that module with the usual setpar commands to the
wanted state and save the file.
Afterwards, use the scripts/presetify script (needs gawk)
to create the textual representation of the .db file.

Example:
Assuming your settings file is febex.db and the new preset shall
be called presets/mypreset.par:

cd presets
../scripts/presetify ../febex.db > mypreset.par

All .par files within presets/ will automatically be compiled
to .db files.

If you want to publish your preset to the git repository, you
should include a short description of your preset within
presets/mypreset_info.txt
